# Team-Profile-Generator


## Description

This CLI takes user input and creates an HTML file that takes all the answers they gave and put them into cards on an web page. This was a good way to practice using test and passing them. I found them useful to help use as a checklist, and a way to help me debug. For example I thought I had all test passed but I was still failing one and it told me exactly where my bug was and what to look for.
